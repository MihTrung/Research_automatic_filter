AI agents play a vital role in facilitating complex decision making and improving operational efficiency in blockchain systems. This collaborative synergy is particularly evident in how multi-agent systems collectively tackle complex tasks to ensure seamless integration within these frameworks. While significant efforts have been made to integrate AI agents and blockchain, most studies overlook the broader potential of AI agents in addressing challenges such as interoperability, scalability, and privacy issues. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by illustrating the interplay between AI agents and blockchain. Specifically, we explore how AI agents enhance decentralized systems and examine blockchain's role in enabling secure and scalable collaboration. Furthermore, we categorize practical applications across domains, such as Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi), asset management, and autonomous systems, providing practical insights and real-world use cases. Additionally, we identify key research challenges, including the complexities of multi-agent coordination, interoperability across diverse systems, and privacy maintenance in decentralized frameworks. Finally, we offer future directions in terms of governance, sovereignty, computation, and interpretability to promote a secure and responsible ecosystem.","[Karim, Md Monjurul; Van, Dong Hoang; Qu, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Khan, Sangeen] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Dept Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Kholodov, Yaroslav] Innopolis Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Innopolis 420500, Russia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS; University of Science & Technology Beijing; Innopolis University","Qu, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",karim@siat.ac.cn; hoang@siat.ac.cn; sangeenkhan2662@gmail.com; qiang@siat.ac.cn; ya.kholodov@innopolis.ru,"Karim, Md Monjurul/C-7056-2019; Khan, Sangeen/G-9074-2016; Qu, Qiang/IXD-9845-2023; Kholodov, Yaroslav/K-7736-2013","Karim, Md Monjurul/0000-0003-1753-065X; Qu, Qiang/0000-0001-5814-8460",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province [2023TQ07A264]; [2020YFA0909100],National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province;,This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFA0909100) and the Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2023TQ07A264).,,116,3,3,25,25,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-5903,,,FUTURE INTERNET,Future Internet,FEB,2025,17,2,,,,,,,57,10.3390/fi17020057,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi17020057,,,31,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,Y3E2L,,gold,,,2025-06-29,WOS:001430992500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although many studies focus on return prediction and do not pay much attention to price formation, revealing its mechanism is essential in risk management, particularly in proactive risk management for investment to improve the performance. Thus, this paper introduces a novel multi-agent model, which is able to explain how agents' portfolio rebalances determine the market price dynamics to clarify the price formation by applying a state space model. The technical novelty is the effective integration of state space modeling and fuzzy logic into a multi agent model with four types of typical investors and their fuzzy trading strategies. By using the estimated unobservable fund flows of each trader in the model, this work proposes a new proactive warning signal. As a result, the signal improves both the risk and return of the investment in the Japanese and United States equity markets. Our findings indicate that the agents' estimated fund flows driving asset prices help us to avoid a market crash, reduce the risk and improve the return in investment practice.","[Mita, Daiya] Nomura Asset Management Co ltd, 12F Toyosu Bayside Cross Tower, 2-2-1 Toyosu, Koto, Tokyo 1350061, Japan; [Mita, Daiya; Takahashi, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Mita, D (corresponding author), Nomura Asset Management Co ltd, 12F Toyosu Bayside Cross Tower, 2-2-1 Toyosu, Koto, Tokyo 1350061, Japan.",daiya.mita@gmail.com; akihikot@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Takahashi, Akihiko/ACJ-7356-2022","Mita, Daiya/0000-0003-0198-5385","CARF, Japan (Center for Advanced Research in Finance), The University of Tokyo","CARF, Japan (Center for Advanced Research in Finance), The University of Tokyo","This work was supported by CARF, Japan (Center for Advanced Research in Finance), The University of Tokyo.",,27,1,1,3,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0952-1976,1873-6769,,ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL,Eng.

Risk management is a high-profile activity for any banking or financial institution, due to stringent regulations on the amount of equity capital to be held, and the amount of trading or operational losses that can be sustained each year. A bank's risk monitoring and pricing methodologies remain critical in the changing market context of steadily increasing trading volumes and speeds, growing diversity of instruments, emergence of new financial products, and collection of myriad data sources. Understanding risk is key to building confidence with clients. Hence risk management will always be a hot topic in the banks. The rapid investor adoption of agentic AI technologies has far exceeding the banks' expectations. In parallel, a rise in adverse or unwanted activities has become more visible. This poses a new set of risks that impact the financial industry. Financial institutions are faced with a success-liability equation, where the effective use of agentic AI tools can have both significant upside but equally significant downside. Banks need to rethink AI as a technology that is no longer solely in their control. Furthermore, regulatory and risk management challenges are relevant today, as they will concern most players in the financial industry next year. The rapid spread of artificial intelligence (AI) using large language models (LLMs) poses risks that banks must address to avoid financial, operational, regulatory, reputational, compliance, and engagement impact. Banks are currently as dominant as other industries, and their response will have ripple effects. The topic is timely, relevant, and considerable in scope. To manage the risk of agentic AI tools, the banks' existing Cultivating Confidence controls and processes for more traditional AI implementations should be refreshed or strengthened in certain areas. These include Auditability, Explainability, Transparency, Supervision, and Disruption paths, and Reliability checks. Although many banks will consider similar risk and control enhancements, institutions will differ in their current maturity, resulting in potentially different levels of risk exposure.",,,,hariish.sriram@gmail.com; bharthsomu@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,PUSAT TEKNOLOGI BAHAN GALIAN NUKLIR-BATAN,JAKARTA,"JL KUNINGAN BARAT, MAMPANG PRAPATAN, JAKARTA, 12710, INDONESIA",0854-1418,,,EKSPLORIUM,Eksplorium,MAY,2025,46,1,,,,,,,,,,,,30,Geology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,3TC1Q,,,,,2025-06-29,WOS:001508354000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are characterized for having high levels of communication, integration and computational capabilities that led them to a certain level of autonomy. Despite the high expectations and vision of CPPS, it still remains an exploratory topic. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been widely used by software engineers to solve traditional computing problems, e.g., banking transactions. Because of their high levels of distribution and autonomous capabilities, MAS have been considered by the research community as a good solution to design and implement CPPS. This work first introduces a collection of requirements and characteristics of smart manufacturing. A comprehensive review of various research applications is presented to understand the current state of the art and the application of agent technology in manufacturing. Considering the smart manufacturing requirements and current research application, a SWOT analysis was formulated which identifies pros and cons of the implementation of agents in industry. The SWOT analysis was further validated by an industrial expert evaluation and the main findings and discussion of the results are presented.","[Pulikottil, Terrin; Estrada-Jimenez, Luis A.; Nikghadam-Hojjati, Sanaz; Barata, Jose] UNINOVA Inst Desenvolvimento Novas Tecnol, Ctr Technol & Syst, Caparica, Portugal; [Pulikottil, Terrin; Estrada-Jimenez, Luis A.; Barata, Jose] NOVA Univ Lisbon, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rehman, Hamood Ur; Mo, Fan] Univ Nottingham, Inst Adv Mfg, Nottingham, England",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Nottingham,"Mo, F (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Inst Adv Mfg, Nottingham, England.",tpulikottil@uninova.pt; lestrada@uninova.pt; Hamood.Rehman@nottingham.ac.uk; Fan.Mo@nottingham.ac.uk; sanaznik@uninova.pt; jab@uninova.pt,"PULIKOTTIL, TERRIN/AAB-9073-2021; Rehman, Hamood/JDC-7393-2023; mo, fan/KHT-4787-2024; Nikghadam-Hojjati, Sanaz/AAO-5541-2020; Barata, Jose/A-4204-2012","Nikghadam-Hojjati, Sanaz/0000-0002-0839-9250; Barata, Jose/0000-0002-6348-1847; Pulikottil, Terrin/0000-0003-2762-0106; Estrada Jimenez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8595-3713",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [814078],European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(Marie Curie Actions),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant No. 814078.,,123,8,8,7,31,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

Voice modality and lip-movement were identified as the important factors to improve seniors' mobile banking service experience and the effect of them were empirically tested by conducting a controlled experiment with betweensubject design. In total, 91 participants who were 55 years or older used the app to complete the given tasks of online banking. Results showed that those in the two voice modality conditions, compared to text agent condition, reported higher levels of trust, perceived ease of use, and social presence. The effect of lip movement of the agent also showed significant results in those three dependant variables. The result of mediation analysis revealed that agent's lip movement increased social presence and perceived ease of use, which further increased trust toward the agent. The results are meaningful especially because trust and perceived ease of use were listed as the main reason for not using online banking services among non-users.

Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been used to simulate and understand the impact of various incentive schemes designed to offset such inequality. We design Touch-Mark, a game based on well-known multiagent particle environment, where two teams (weak and strong) with unequal but changing skill levels compete against each other. For training such a game, we propose a novel controller-assisted MARL algorithm C-MADDPG, which empowers each agent with an ensemble of policies along with a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space and triggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an underlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such that the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that despite the incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong team. On inspecting, we realize that an overall incentive scheme for the weak team does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and improve. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to learn and, as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase performs at par with the stronger team. The final goal of this article has been to formulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of the two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with an RL agent, which takes minimum information from the environment.","[Koley, Paramita; Bhattacharya, Sourangshu; Ganguly, Niloy] IIT Kharagpur, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Maiti, Aurghya] Adobe Inc, Bengaluru 560103, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Koley, P (corresponding author), IIT Kharagpur, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",paramita.koley@iitkgp.ac.in; aurghya.kgp@gmail.com; sourangshu@cse.iitkgp.ac.in; niloy@cse.iitkgp.ac.in,,"Koley, Paramita/0000-0001-5601-4514",Intel Corporation,Intel Corporation(Intel Corporation),This work was supported by the Intel Corporation.,,75,0,0,3,16,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

Par-ticipants respond to six scenarios depicting interactions with banking service chatbots of varying appearance and intelligence. Results show that anthropomorphic response depend on perceptions of agent appearance, cognitive intelligence, and emotional intelligence. Users perceive more humanness in highly intelligent but disembodied agents rather than in highly intelligent agents that have poorly designed appearances. And users who have strong tendencies to anthropomorphize non-sentient entities are less likely to form anthropomorphic response when interacting with agents with high cognitive intelligence.

The Golog interpreter automatically maintains an explicit model of the agent's environment on the basis of user supplied axioms about the preconditions and effects of actions and the initial state of the environment. This allows agent programs to query the state of the environment and consider the effects of various possible courses of action before deciding how to act. This paper discusses a substantial multi-agent application developed in Golog: a system to support personal banking over computer networks.

Secondly, aiming at the heterogeneity of depositors, construct an improved SIS model based on node attitudes to represent the decision-making process of a bank run during the spread of panic emotions in social networks. Finally, three sets of simulation experiments were designed using a multi-agent model to analyse the interaction between bank risk contagion and depositor panic contagion under initial asset shocks, the sensitivity of two types of risk contagion, and bank risk contagion under initial rumour shocks. Results show that: (i) The contagion of bank risks and the spread of panic emotions of depositors will affect each other, which will further expand the scope of the spread of bank risk and panic emotions; (ii) depositors in social networks are more likely to be affected by the negative emotions around them; (iii) The key to stabilizing the banking system, while sufficient liquidity can effectively help the banking system resist rumour attacks.","[Gong, Shuwen; Zou, Huiwen] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350000, Fujian, Peoples R China",Fuzhou University,"Gong, SW (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou 350000, Fujian, Peoples R China.",muziliedu@163.com,,,Fujian Natural Science Foundation Project Research on Pricing of Catastrophe Risk Bonds Based on Extreme Value Theory and Copula Function [2017J01794],Fujian Natural Science Foundation Project Research on Pricing of Catastrophe Risk Bonds Based on Extreme Value Theory and Copula Function,"Fujian Natural Science Foundation Project Research on Pricing of Catastrophe Risk Bonds Based on Extreme Value Theory and Copula Function, Grant/Award Number: 2017J01794",,46,5,5,6,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1076-9307,1099-1158,,INT J FINANC ECON,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model was developed to investigate the value-in-use perceptions of AI-based mobile banking applications via five antecedents: baseline perceptions of current bank service delivery; service delivery configuration benefits; general data security; safety perceptions of specific mobile banking services; and perceptions of AI service delivery. Data were collected from 218 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - This study highlights the role and importance of the sequential relationships that impact the assessment of AIMB. The findings suggest that service delivery and the customer's role in value co-creation change as AI is introduced into a digital self-service technology channel. Furthermore, AIMB offers transaction-oriented (utilitarian) value propositions more so than relationship-oriented (hedonic) value propositions. Research limitations/implications - The sample consisted on digital natives. Additional age cohorts are needed. Practical implications - As financial institutions redirect their business models toward digital self-service technology channels, the need for customers to feel comfortable while interacting with an AI agent will be critical for enhancing the customer experience and firm performance. Originality/value - The authors extend the service-dominant logic (SDL) literature by showing that value co-creation is a function of both firms' technologies and consumers' value-in-use, a finding that appears to be unique in the literature. The authors advance the digital transformation literature by evaluating AIMB as an interactive process that requires an understanding of key technology constructs, including perceptions of baseline service relationships, desired service configurations, security and safety issues and whether AI is useful for value co-creation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first SDL framework that investigates interactive and structural relationships to explain value-in-use perceptions of AIMB.","[Payne, Elizabeth H.

Within a community, agents group together offering special e-services for effective, reliable, and mutual benefits. Usually, an agent community is composed of specialized agents performing one or more tasks in a single domain/sub-domain, or in highly intersecting domains. However, secure Multi-Agent Systems require severe mechanisms in order to prevent malicious attacks. Several limits affect exiting secure agents platform, such as the lack of a strong authentication system, the lack of a flexible distributed mechanism for access control and the lack of a system for storing past behaviors of agent/user. Biometric owner agents authentication, agent/users policies to regulate agent's behavior and actions, and agent/users reputation level to select trusted agents can be used to overcome the above limits and enhance the level of security for these applications. In this paper an extended JADE-S based framework for developing secure Multi-Agent Systems is proposed. The framework functionalities are extended by self-contained FPGA biometric sensors providing secure and fast user authentication service. Each agent owner, by means of biometric authentication, acquires his/her own X.509v3 digital certificate. Policy files and a flexible, fast distributed Access Control Mechanism can regulate behavior and actions of any users/agent inside the platform. In addition, a mechanism based on the agent reputation is used: reputation is an attribute associated to each owner and/or agent on the basis of its past behavior and integrity. In order to prove the feasibility of the proposed framework, we have developed a multi-agent e-Banking system.

A key feature of SCF is the provision of financial support based on a core business that extends good credit to upstream and downstream businesses and facilitates lending without taking unacceptable risks. To this end, a multi-agent system (MAS) approach is proposed to automate and facilitate the process of selecting the best possible financing options in the supply chain. It must be decided whether internal or external financing is to be used and which internal player offers the most favourable financing option. This second decision-making problem is realized in the MAS by an automated negotiation process in the form of an auction. The model considers the information asymmetry between external and internal supply chain actors and additional external effects for internal supply chain actors while taking over financing. Numerical experiments show the functionality and advantages of the specially designed negotiation protocol.","[Fiedler, Alexandra] Univ Appl Sci Merseburg, Fac Business Adm & Informat Sci, Eberhard Leibnitz Str 2, D-06217 Merseburg, Germany",,"Fiedler, A (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Merseburg, Fac Business Adm & Informat Sci, Eberhard Leibnitz Str 2, D-06217 Merseburg, Germany.",alexandra.fiedler@hs-merseburg.de,"Fiedler, Alexandra/LBH-0695-2024",,federal-state funding initiative Innovative Hochschule - Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt; joint project TransInno LSA - Transfer and innovation service in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt [03IHS013],federal-state funding initiative Innovative Hochschule - Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt; joint project TransInno LSA - Transfer and innovation service in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt,"The work is supported by the federal-state funding initiative Innovative Hochschule, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt.

These phenomena can be transmitted like a domino effect, and they are referred to as the contagion effect in the scientific literature. In this research, one of the four forms of financial contagion, known as residual contagion, is studied on the mortgage loan market in Romania using agent-based modeling. By considering the economic crisis of 2007-2009, also supported by the mortgage crisis, in the present paper, we aim to study the Romanian mortgage market in 2022 through the use of machine learning techniques and agent-based modeling. The purpose of this research is to capture the potential systemic risks that can outline a residual financial contagion effect. The simulation results highlight the fact that the degree of connectivity between the commercial banks in Romania and the way in which they are interconnected have a major importance in the emergence and propagation of contagion effects. The proposed approach and the obtained results can offer more insight to policymakers on how the contagion effect takes place within the banking sector.","[Ionescu, Stefan; Chirita, Nora; Nica, Ionut; Delcea, Camelia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest 0105552, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Delcea, C (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest 0105552, Romania.",camelia.delcea@csie.ase.ro,"Chirita, Nora/KBA-6753-2024; Ionescu, Stefan-Andrei/JEF-9848-2023; Nica, Ionut/ABA-4243-2021; Delcea, Camelia/C-4343-2011","Nica, Ionut/0000-0003-2118-3654; Delcea, Camelia/0000-0003-3589-1969; Ionescu, Stefan-Andrei/0000-0002-0469-3022",,,,,106,8,9,6,20,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2023,15,15,,,,,,,12037,10.3390/su151512037,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151512037,,,32,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,O7US1,,gold,,,2025-06-29,WOS:001045823400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our special attention is paid to the role of debt in the two processes. With the agent-based modeling approach, macro phenomena are well founded in micro-based causalities. A hypothetical economy composed of a banking system and multiple traders is proposed. Instead of being a pure financial intermediary, the banking system is viewed as the center of money creation and an accelerator of money circulation. Agents finance their expenditures not only by their own savings but also through bank loans. Through mathematical calculations and numerical simulation, we identify the determinants of money multiplier and those of velocity of money. In contrast to the traditional money creation model, the money multiplier is determined not only by the behavior of borrowing but also by the behavior of repayment as well. The velocity of money is found to be influenced by both money-related factors such as the expenditure habits of agents with respect to their income and wealth and debt-related factors such as borrowing and repayment behaviors of debtors and the reserve requirements faced by banks.

It is also one of its evaluation criteria. It presents to investors the effectiveness of using their capital. Increasing profitability may be treated as a symptom of shareholder wealth, while its reduction may be a signal indicating a deterioration of the financial situation of the company. An investment in a company will be attractive to investors if the results obtained by it will enable the benefit from the dividend to be paid and if the share prices will show an upward trend. Therefore, profit and profitability are categories dependent on the company and affect the wealth of its owners. The ROE ratio is synthetic and is linked to, among others with the size of sales, asset use activity, and the size of the company's debt. However, the decisions regarding the capital structure of a company should be made not only by purely economic and financial analyses but also should take into account the social and environmental effects of economic activities. To take into account not only short-term financial goals but also long-term sustainable development goals during the decision-making process, we need intelligent and creative multi-criteria decision support tools. Bio-inspired artificial intelligence techniques-such as evolutionary algorithms, deep neural networks, or swarm algorithms, to give only a few examples-are gaining more and more popularity in the recent years. Evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques that are modeled on the processes of evolution that are taking place in natural populations. They can find approximate solutions to the NP-hard global, multi-modal, and multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach-an agent-based bio-inspired system supporting decisions in the area of corporate finance, which takes into account not only financial goals but also the sustainable development goals. The system will allow for multi-objective optimization with the use of bio-inspired algorithms. In this paper, we will concentrate on one module of the proposed system-the evolutionary algorithm optimizing the ROE factor. During the experiments, we will verify the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide decision makers with reasonable, useful, and, at the same time, also innovative and non-obvious solutions concerning the desired capital structure of a given company, which usually operates in a rapidly changing environment. The proposed system will allow for taking into account more than one criteria and perform multi-objective optimization with the use of an evolutionary algorithm or an agent-based co-evolutionary algorithm, so it will be possible to include also the long-term goals of sustainable development in the future.","[Drezewski, Rafal; Makowka, Maciej] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Kruk, Sylwia] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Org Enterprises, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow; Cracow University of Economics,"Drezewski, R (corresponding author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.",drezew@agh.edu.pl,"Kruk, Sylwia/AAO-5058-2021; Drezewski, Rafal/H-9698-2012","Kruk, Sylwia/0000-0002-6978-4398; Drezewski, Rafal/0000-0001-8607-3478","AGH University of Science and Technology Statutory Project; Faculty of Management, Cracow University of Economics","AGH University of Science and Technology Statutory Project; Faculty of Management, Cracow University of Economics","This work was supported in part by the AGH University of Science and Technology Statutory Project and in part by the Faculty of Management, Cracow University of Economics subsidies granted for maintaining the research capacity.",,102,4,4,2,36,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2018,6,,,,,,51911,51930,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870201,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870201,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,GW9IK,,gold,,,2025-06-29,WOS:000447298100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, in this study, we propose a variable-order fractional supply chain network. The dynamic of the system is investigated using the Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation diagram. It is demonstrated that a minor change in the system's fractional-derivative may dramatically affect its behavior. Then, distributed consensus tracking of the multi-agent network is studied. To this end, a control technique based on the sliding concept and Chebyshev neural network estimator is offered. The system's stability is demonstrated using the Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat's lemma.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is designed to solve the sequential decision-making tasks, like the stock trading. The output of the RL is the policy which can be presented as the probability values of the possible actions based on a given state. The policy is optimized by the reward function. However, even if the profit is considered as the natural reward function, a trading agent equipped with an RL model has several serious problems. Specifically, profit is only obtained after executing sell action, different profits exist at the same time step due to the varying-length transactions and the hold action deals with two opposite states, empty or nonempty position. To alleviate these shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce a new trading action called wait for the empty position status and design the appropriate rewards to all actions. Based on the new action space and reward functions, a novel approach named Transaction-aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning (TAIRL) is proposed. TAIRL rewards all trading actions for avoiding the reward bias and dilemma. TAIRL is evaluated by backtesting on 12 stocks of US, UK and China stock markets, and compared against other state-of-art RL methods and moving average trading methods.

In many of these services, it is, however, necessary that security is guaranteed. Unless we guarantee the security services based on agent-based systems, these services will face significant deployment problems. In this paper, we survey existing work related to security in multi-agent systems, especially focused on access control and trust/reputation, and then present our analyses.

The multi-agent simulation of e-banking channel selection behavior of elderly customers is carried out from the perspectives of channel diffusion speed and customer channel selection proportion in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research shows that channel performance and individual differences of customers affect the adoption of e-banking by elderly customers. This study also has found that network size and network density can regulate the impact of channel performance on the selection behavior of elderly groups.

The use of artificial intelligence in teaching executes functions such as, for instance, natural language generation, personalisation of learning and proctoring. At the same time, besides the organisation of the educational process or the design of learning ma-terials, artificial intelligence technologies in teaching also include teaching a foreign language or learning it. Due to the simplification of the process of creating such tech-nologies, which currently, due to the development of tools for their development, does not require the same training as before, dialogue-based & scy;omputer-assisted language learning plays a significant role in the use of artificial intelligence technologies in teach-ing foreign languages. Dialogue-based & scy;omputer-assisted language learning provides students with the op-portunity to develop and form foreign language skills through interaction with a con-versational agent or a bot, which are also often referred to as social interactive agents and are defined as agents capable of independently communicating with people and with each other in a socially reasonable way via multimodal behaviours. Chatbots are a category of conversational agents, which, in turn, are a separate class of dialogue sys-tems.The attention of researchers is currently paid to the implementation of intelligent agents in foreign language teaching and overcoming the difficulties associated with it. The purpose of the article is to provide a theoretical review of publications devoted to the issues of foreign language teaching through the use of interactive dialogue sys-tems or conversational agents; to classify the intelligent agents currently used in foreign language teaching in accordance with the criteria proposed earlier; to describe the ac-cumulated experience of introducing intelligent agents into foreign language teaching, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using certain bots in specific situa-tions; to identify the didactic potential of chatbots as a type of conversational agents based on AI technologies; the features of integrating chatbots into the process of devel-oping the students' oral-speech and written-speech skills, as well as skills of interaction. The works of Russian and foreign authors published over the past 5 years devoted to the study of artificial intelligence technologies in foreign language teaching were selected for the analysis. The research methods are the analysis of research literature and classification. In the course of the research, notions such as conversational agents and chat-bots were defined and the history of their development from the second half of the 20th century to the present day was described. Based on the works of researchers, the criteria were selected for the classification of intellectual agents currently used in teach-ing foreign languages, on the basis of which their typology was proposed. Finally, the results of the studies describing attempts to introduce such systems into the foreign language teaching process were studied, as a result of which their advantages and dis-advantages were described, establishing the prospects for further research on the issue","[Titova, Svetlana V.; Temuryan, Kristina T.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Titova, SV (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia.",stitova3@gmail.com; christinatem5@gmail.com,"Titova, Svetlana/P-9653-2015",,,,,,65,2,2,17,38,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1999-6195,2311-3235,,YAZYK KULT,Yazyk Kult.,,2024,,65,,,,,,,,10.17223/19996195/65/12,http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/19996195/65/12,,,297,Language & Linguistics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Linguistics,UY9K0,,,,,2025-06-29,WOS:001251739700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result, this paper resorts to the evolutionary game theory, and proposes a novel multi-agent financial investment decision method. Specifically, an evolutionary game theory-based decision-making approach is formulated as the main model for the research purpose. By considering the strategic choices and adaptability among various entities, a comprehensive analysis of the behavior and decision-making process of entities in the financial market is achieved. This paper combines stock exchanges and financial data providers (Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters) to conduct case studies on this method, verifying its effectiveness and feasibility in practical applications. By comparing traditional financial investment decision-making methods, it can be seen that the proposal has significant advantages in improving investment efficiency, reducing risks, and responding to market volatility.

The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs' difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation.","[Li, Ming] Jinan Univ, Sch Intelligent Syst Sci & Engn, Zhuhai Campus, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ming] Jinan Univ, Inst Phys Internet, Zhuhai Campus, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shao, Saijun] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Econ, Dept Transportat Econ & Logist Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Ye, Qiwen] South China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Gangyan] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Gangyan] Harbin Inst Technol, Intelligent Transportat Lab, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban Planning & Decis Making, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, George Q.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, HKU ZIRI Lab Phys Internet, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University; Shenzhen University; South China Normal University; Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; University of Hong Kong,"Shao, SJ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Econ, Dept Transportat Econ & Logist Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",aaron.shaosj@gmail.com,"Shao, Saijun/AAH-3531-2020; Huang, George/O-9005-2018; Li, Ming/AGC-8952-2022; HUANG, George Q./C-1880-2009; Xu, Gangyan/A-2075-2016","Li, Ming/0000-0003-4119-7340; HUANG, George Q./0000-0002-2362-6001; Xu, Gangyan/0000-0001-9537-9006",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71901146]; National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB1705401]; Zhejiang Provincial Government; Hangzhou Municipal Government; Lin'an City Government,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Zhejiang Provincial Government; Hangzhou Municipal Government; Lin'an City Government,"This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71901146, and National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No. 2019YFB1705401.

The availability of a reliable and comprehensive conversational agent to which patients could be directed would be a valuable supplement to clinical intervention.BackgroundThe Artificial Intelligence in Visual Impairment (AIVI) Study is a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether ongoing information support for people with visual impairment (VI) can be provided by a dialogue-based digital assistant. The phase of the AIVI Study reported here explored the different dimensions of the information-seeking behaviour of individuals with VI: in particular, their need for information, the methods for obtaining it at present, and their views on the use of a digital assistant.MethodsQualitative data were collected from 120 UK-resident adults who responded to an online survey who were either visually impaired (86.7%), a carer or family member of someone with VI (5.8%), or a professional involved in the support of those with VI (7.5%). In addition, 10 in-depth 1:1 semi-structured interviews explored opinions in more detail. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the findings.ResultsAnalysis of information needs identified 7 major themes: ocular condition; equipment, technology and adaptations; daily activities; registration; finance/employment; emotional support; and support for the carer. Participants used a wide variety of methods to access information from many sources and explained the barriers to access. Participants accepted the merit of a dialogue system aiding in a goal-directed search for specific information, but expressed reservations about its abilities in other areas, such as providing emotional support.ConclusionsParticipants highlighted potential benefits, limitations, and requirements in using a digital assistant to access information about VI.

A survey was conducted involving 265 investors in Turkey who have private pension investments and have experienced digital banking. The outcomes of this study indicate that the factors affecting robo-advisor usage intention in private pension investments are performance expectancy, social impact, facilitating conditions, financial risk tolerance, and trust. Also, trust positively affects financial risk tolerance. However, effort expectancy and the need for interaction with service employees have no effect on the intention to use a robo-advisor.

J,"Sullivan, RS; Longo, L",,,,"Sullivan, Robert S.; Longo, Luca",,,Explaining Deep Q-Learning Experience Replay with SHapley Additive exPlanations,MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,deep reinforcement learning; experience replay; SHapley Additive exPlanations; eXplainable artificial intelligence,,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in optimizing complex control and decision-making processes but Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) lacks interpretability, limiting its adoption in regulated sectors like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. Difficulties arise from DRL's opaque decision-making, hindering efficiency and resource use, this issue is amplified with every advancement. While many seek to move from Experience Replay to A3C, the latter demands more resources. Despite efforts to improve Experience Replay selection strategies, there is a tendency to keep the capacity high. We investigate training a Deep Convolutional Q-learning agent across 20 Atari games intentionally reducing Experience Replay capacity from 1x106 to 5x102. We find that a reduction from 1x104 to 5x103 doesn't significantly affect rewards, offering a practical path to resource-efficient DRL. To illuminate agent decisions and align them with game mechanics, we employ a novel method: visualizing Experience Replay via Deep SHAP Explainer. This approach fosters comprehension and transparent, interpretable explanations, though any capacity reduction must be cautious to avoid overfitting. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of reducing Experience Replay and advocates for transparent, interpretable decision explanations using the Deep SHAP Explainer to promote enhancing resource efficiency in Experience Replay.","[Sullivan, Robert S.; Longo, Luca] Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Artificial Intelligence & Cognit Load Res Lab, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland",,"Longo, L (corresponding author), Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Artificial Intelligence & Cognit Load Res Lab, Dublin D07 ADY7, Ireland.",robssully@gmail.com; luca.longo@tudublin.ie,"Longo, dr.

By modeling each intersection as an autonomous agent, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) shows remarkable performance in solving dynamic TSC. However, most of TSC methods based on MARL suffer from a non-stationarity problem since agents update their policies simultaneously. To resolve this issue, this paper considers multi-intersection TSC as a multi-agent sequential decision-making process with policy online learning. We utilize a sequential model such as Transformer architecture to learn the multi-agent joint policy. By carefully designing the advantage function of each agent, the monotonic improvement property can be guaranteed. Moreover, to fully exploit the advantages of both simultaneous and sequential MARL, we further propose a novel MARL network selection algorithm (MARL-NS) which selectively employs simultaneous MARL only at states that sequential MARL might fall into local optimum. Our theory proves that MARL-NS preserves cooperative MARL converge properties. Finally, we validate the proposed MARL-NS method on a unified TSC benchmark, LibSignal. Experimental results show that our method can outperform the baseline methods in network-level and arterial coordination.","[Zhang, Haipeng; Yu, Jilin; Zhang, Ruonan] Guangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Liuzhou 545006, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhiwen; Luo, Gongkun] Guangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Liuzhou 545006, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhiwen] Guangxi Key Lab Big Data Finance & Econ, Nanning 545006, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Caoqing] Guangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Big Data & Artificial Intelligence, Nanning 545006, Peoples R China; [Wu, Weiwei; Wang, Wanyuan] Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Guangxi University of Science & Technology; Guangxi University of Science & Technology; Guangxi University of Finance & Economics; Southeast University - China,"Wang, ZW (corresponding author), Guangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Liuzhou 545006, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZW (corresponding author), Guangxi Key Lab Big Data Finance & Econ, Nanning 545006, Peoples R China.;Wang, WY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",2545712691@qq.com; wzw69@126.com; jcqng@163.com; weiweiwu@seu.edu.cn; wywang@seu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62466004, 61962007, 62266009]; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Big Data in Finance and Economics [FEDOP2022A06]; Key Research and Development Projects in Jiangsu Province [BE2021001-2]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Big Data in Finance and Economics; Key Research and Development Projects in Jiangsu Province,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62466004, Grant 61962007, and Grant 62266009; in part by Guangxi Key Laboratory of Big Data in Finance and Economics under Grant FEDOP2022A06; and in part by the Key Research and Development Projects in Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2021001-2.",,39,0,0,10,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1524-9050,1558-0016,,IEEE T INTELL TRANSP,IEEE Trans.
