The CD-ABSA tries to use the valuable information in a source domain to extract aspect terms and evaluate their sentiment polarities in a target domain. It can considerably increase the usage of the source domain annotation resources while also reducing the workload of newer domain data annotation. one of the main components of the CD-ABSA is aspect extraction. In this paper, we utilized the most common topic modelling techniques: LDA and LSA to extract aspects from the reviews as it does not require labelled data. The topics are extracted from the education domain of the Course and Teacher Performance Evaluation (CTPE) dataset. In this paper, we also evaluated the different hyper-parameters on the CD-ABSA model and selected the best and optimal combination. The proposed methodology train on domain-dependent and independent word embedding that achieves CD-ABSA, in particularly end-to-end fashion. The experiment carries out on Academica dataset, which consists of students' comments/feedback and SemEval-2014 dataset, which includes laptops and restaurants reviews. The evaluation metrics such as (precision, recall, F1 score and validation Accuracy) is considered while judging the LSTM classifier performance for CD-ABSA as a result.","[Kandhro, Irfan Ali; Wagan, Asif Ali] Sindh Madressatul Islam Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan; [Kumar, Kamlesh; Shaikh, Zubair Uddin] Sindh Madressatul Islam Univ, Dept Software Engn, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan",,"Kandhro, IA (corresponding author), Sindh Madressatul Islam Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.",irfan@smiu.edu.pk,"Wagan, Asif Ali/JRX-7319-2023",,,,,,36,1,1,2,11,MEHRAN UNIV ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY,JAMSHORO,"C/O MS MUMTAZ S MEMON, LIBRARIAN, JAMSHORO, 00000, PAKISTAN",0254-7821,2413-7219,,MEHRAN UNIV RES J EN,Mehran Univ.

Different ABSA tasks are designed for different real-world applications. However, application scenarios of ABSA tasks are often diverse, typically requiring training separate systems for each task on the task-specific labeled data and making separate predictions. Second, different tasks often contain shared sentiment elements. Training task-specific models either fail to exploit the shared knowledge among multiple ABSA tasks effectively or neglect the complementarity between tasks. Third, despite the existence of the compound ABSA task such as quadruple extraction and triple extraction, it is not easy to obtain satisfactory performance due to the coupling of multiple elements. To tackle these issues, we present UnifiedABSA, a general-purpose ABSA framework based on multi-task instruction tuning, aiming at one-model-for-all-tasks. We also introduce a new annotation-decoupled multi-task learning mechanism that only depends on annotation on the compound task rather than all tasks. This mechanism not only fully utilizes the existing annotations from the compound task, but also alleviates the complicated coupling relationship among multiple elements, making the learning more effective. Extensive experiments show that UnifiedABSA can consistently outperform dedicated models in fully-supervised and low-resource settings for almost all 11 ABSA tasks. We also conduct further experiments to demonstrate the general applicability of our framework.","[Wang, Zengzhi; Xia, Rui; Yu, Jianfei] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Xia, R (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.",zzwang@njust.edu.cn; rxia@njust.edu.cn; jfyu@njust.edu.cn,"Yu, Jianfei/GYD-3660-2022",,"Natural Science Foundation of China [62076133, 62006117]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China Under Grant 62076133 and Grant 62006117.

Findings reveal the presence of a sizeable inactive group of tourists who were indifferent towards post -travel behavioral intentions. The study recommends destination managers to consider managing tourist emo-tions, specifically sad surprise, in the travel phase of the tourists to strategically manage the post-travel behavior of tourists on social media.

The absA1 non-antibiotic-producing mutants, which are unpigmented, spontaneously acquire pigmented colony sectors. Genetic analysis established that the pigmented sectors contain second-site suppressive mutations, sab (for suppressor of abs). Phenotypic characterization showed that sab strains produce all four antibiotics; some overproduce antibiotics and are designated Pha, for precocious hyperproduction of antibiotics. A set of sab mutations responsible for suppression was localized by plasmid-mediated and protoplast fusion mapping techniques to the vicinity of the absA locus. DNA cloned from this region was used to construct phage that could transduce sab mutations. Sequence analysis of sab strains defined sab mutations in both the absA1 gene and the absA2 gene; the latter encodes the two-component system's response regulator.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Champness, W (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,38,13,15,1,3,SOC GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY,READING,"MARLBOROUGH HOUSE, BASINGSTOKE RD, SPENCERS WOODS, READING, BERKS, ENGLAND RG7 1AE",1350-0872,,,MICROBIOL-UK,Microbiology-(UK),SEP,1999,145.0,,9.0,,,,2343.0,2353.0,,10.1099/00221287-145-9-2343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/00221287-145-9-2343,,,11,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,240MD,10517587.0,Bronze,,,2025-06-08,WOS:000082829000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous genetic analysis had suggested that the phosphorylated form of AbsA2 acted as a negative regulator of antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor (T. B. Anderson, P. Brian, and W. C. Champness, Mol. Microbiol. 39:553-566, 2001). Genomic sequence data subsequently provided by the Sanger Centre (Cambridge, United Kingdom) revealed that absA was located within the gene cluster for production of one of the four antibiotics, calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA). In this paper we have identified numerous transcriptional start sites within the CDA cluster and have shown that the original antibiotic-negative mutants used to identify absA exhibit a stronger negative regulation of promoters upstream of the proposed CDA biosynthetic genes than of promoters in the clusters responsible for production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. The same antibiotic-negative mutants also showed an increase in transcription from a promoter divergent to that of absA, upstream of a putative ABC transporter, in addition to an increase in transcription of absA itself. Interestingly, the negative regulation of the biosynthetic transcripts did not appear to be mediated by transcriptional regulation of cdaR (a gene encoding a homolog of the pathway-specific regulators of the act and red clusters) or by any other recognizable transcriptional regulator associated with the cluster. The role of absA in regulating the expression of the diverse antibiotic biosynthesis clusters in the genome is discussed in light of its location in the cda cluster.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Champness, WC (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Giltner Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,45,82,101,2,13,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0021-9193,,,J BACTERIOL,J.

First, the BERT pre-trained model is used to obtain the word vectors. Second, position-POS awareness mechanism is designed to focus on words of important POS in the local context. Then, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a densely connected graph convolutional network are constructed to capture the global information.

SWNTs provide a 3D porous and conductive network for the polymer immobilization. The nanocomposite film was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicated that this composite-modified electrode had strong electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of trifluoperazine (TFP). TFP could effectively accumulate on the modified electrode and generate a sensitive anodic peak at 0.72 V (versus SCE) in pH 6.1 phosphate buffer solution. Under the selected conditions, the anodic peak current of TFP was linear with its concentration within the range from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-5) mol L-1 and 1.0 x 10(-5) to 1.0 x 10(-4) mol L-1, and the detection limit was 1.0 x 10(-9) mol L-1 (S/N = 3). This method was successfully applied to the detection of trifluoperazine in drug samples and the recovery was satisfactory. In comparison with the SWNTs/GCE or poly-ABSA/GCE prepared in the similar way, this composite-modified electrode exhibited better catalytic activity.

Streptomyces coelicolor produces several structurally and genetically distinct antibiotics. The S. coelicolor absA locus was defined by four UV-induced mutations that globally blocked antibiotic biosynthesis without blocking morphological differentiation. We show that the absA locus encodes a putative eubacterial two-component sensor kinase-response regulator system. All four mutations lie within a single open reading frame, designated absA1, which is predicted to encode a sensor histidine kinase. A second gene downstream of absA1, absA2, is predicted to encode the cognate response regulator. In marked contrast to the antibiotic-deficient phenotype of the previously described absA mutants, the phenotype caused by disruption mutations in the absA locus is precocious hyperproduction of the antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. Precocious hyperproduction of these antibiotics is correlated with premature expression of XylE activity in a transcriptional fusion to an actinorhodin biosynthetic gene. We propose that the absA locus encodes a Signal transduction mechanism that negatively regulates synthesis of the multiple antibiotics produced by S. coelicolor.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT MICROBIOL,E LANSING,MI 48824",Michigan State University,,,,"Santos, Richard/0009-0008-6252-7517",,,,,70,62,69,1,8,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1325 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4171",0021-9193,,,J BACTERIOL,J.

Sentiment analysis (SA) is the umbrella term for techniques and approaches that analyze user's sentiments, emotions, opinions in text or other media. The need for a better understanding of these opinions paved the way to novel approaches that focus on the analysis of the sentiment related to specific features of a product, giving birth to the field of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Although the increasing interest in this discipline, there is still confusion regarding the basic concepts of ABSA: terms like sentiment, affect, emotion, opinion, are used as synonyms while they represent different concepts. This often leads to an incorrect analysis of the users' opinions.This work presents an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques and approaches for ABSA, highlighting the main critical issues related to current trends in this field. Following this analysis, a new reference model for SA and ABSA, namely the KnowMIS-ABSA model, is proposed. The model is grounded on the consideration that sentiment, affect, emotion and opinion are very different concepts and that it is profoundly wrong to use the same metric and the same technique to measure them. Accordingly, we argue that different tools and metrics should be adopted to measure each of the dimensions of an opinion. A qualitative case study, regarding product reviews, is proposed to motivate the advantages of the KnowMIS-ABSA model.","[D'Aniello, Giuseppe; Gaeta, Matteo] Univ Salerno, Dept Informat & Elect Engn & Appl Math, Knowledge Management & Informat Syst Lab KnowMIS, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [La Rocca, Ilaria] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Salerno,"Gaeta, M (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Informat & Elect Engn & Appl Math, Knowledge Management & Informat Syst Lab KnowMIS, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",gidaniello@unisa.it; mgaeta@unisa.it; ilarialarocca0@gmail.com,"Gaeta, Matteo/GNM-5767-2022; D'Aniello, Giuseppe/K-8637-2018","D'Aniello, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8687-9348; Gaeta, Matteo/0000-0001-7209-3355",,,,,112,31,32,3,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-2821,1573-7462,,ARTIF INTELL REV,Artif.

Despite the extensive research undertaken on ABSA, the limited availability of training data remains a significant obstacle that hinders the performance of previous studies. Moreover, previous works have predominantly focused on concatenating semantic and syntactic features to predict sentiment polarity, which inadvertently severed the intrinsic connection. Several studies have attempted to utilize multi-layer graph convolution for the purpose of extracting syntactic characteristics. However, this approach has encountered the issue of gradient explosion. This paper investigates the possibilities of leveraging ChatGPT for aspect-level text augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce an improved gated attention mechanism specifically designed for graph convolutional networks to mitigates the problem of gradient explosion. By enriching the features of the dependency graph with a sentiment knowledge base, we strengthen the relationship between aspect words and the polarity of the contextual sentiment. It is worth mentioning that we employ cross-fusion to effectively integrate textual semantic and syntactic features.

While certain point mutations in absA1 reduce or eliminate the synthesis of several antibiotics, null mutations in these genes bring about enhanced antibiotic synthesis. We show here that AbsA1, which is unusual in sequence and structure, is both an AbsA2 kinase and an AbsA2similar toP phosphatase. The half-life of AbsA2similar toP in solution is 68.6 min, consistent with a role in maintaining a relatively stable state of transcriptional repression or activation. We find that mutations in the absA locus that enhance antibiotic synthesis impair AbsA2 kinase activity and that mutations that repress antibiotic synthesis impair AbsA2similar toP phosphatase activity. These results support a model in which the phosphorylation state of AbsA2 is determined by the balance of the kinase and phosphatase activities of AbsA1 and where AbsA2similar toP represses antibiotic biosynthetic genes either directly or indirectly.","McMaster Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biomed Sci, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University Hospital,"McMaster Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Biochem & Biomed Sci, 1200 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.",nodwellj@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,39,57,71,1,8,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0021-9193,1098-5530,,J BACTERIOL,J.

Meanwhile, a simple and sensitive sensor was fabricated to detect normetanephrine (NMN), which is one of the significant diagnostic markers for diseases. Compared with bare GCE, the p-m-ABSA film prepared on GCE surface has the advantage of increasing electrode surface area and active sites distinctly, thus obviously improving the electrocatalytic activity. The results demonstrated that the developed electrochemical sensor exhibited high sensitivity, stability, selectivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity towards NMN. The surface morphology of p-m-ABSA/GCE was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), indicating that the electrode surface had a layered structure.

However, the development of such manually curated datasets is a labour-intensive process and therefore existing ABSA datasets cover only a few domains and they are limited in size. In response, we present FABSA (Feedback ABSA), a new large-scale and multi-domain ABSA dataset of feedback reviews. FABSA consists of approximately 10,500 reviews which span across 10 domains. We conduct a number of experiments to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models when applied to the FABSA dataset. Our results demonstrate that ABSA models can generalise across different domains when trained on our FABSA dataset while the performance of the models is enhanced when using a larger training dataset.

Depositing Mg -Al LDH nanocomposites onto the surface of the p-m-ABSA composite resulted in an effective electrical response by increasing the electrode surface area and enhancing the electron transfer process, so the electrocatalytic activity was significantly enhanced. The research illustrated that the fabricated sensor (Mg -Al LDH/p-m-ABSA/GCE) exhibited strong affinity, high sensitivity, and selectivity towards methyl parathion (MP) and fenitrothion (FNT). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the surface morphology of the modified electrode and showed that the p-m-ABSA film and a few p-m-ABSA nanoparticles were coated on the surface. The surface area of the electrode was further enlarged by Mg -Al LDH owing to their layered nanostructure. Under optimal conditions, the anodic current had a linear relation equal to 0.1-20.0 mu M MP and 0.01-50.0 mu M FNT, with detection limits (S/ N = 3) of 33.0 nM MP and 3.5 nM FNT, respectively.

Here, we show that the response regulator encoded by the absA2 gene is a negative regulator of these antibiotic gene clusters, A genetic analysis shows that the phosphorylated form of the AbsA2 response regulator (phospho-AbsA2), generated by the cognate AbsA1 sensor histidine kinase, is required for normal growth phase regulation of antibiotic synthesis. In the absence of phospho-AbsA2, antibiotics are produced earlier and more abundantly. Overexpression of AbsA1 also deregulates antibiotic synthesis, apparently shifting the AbsA1 protein from a kinase-active to a phospho-AbsA2 phosphatase-active form. The absA1 and absA2 genes, which are adjacent, are located in one of the antibiotic gene clusters that they regulate, the cluster for the calcium-dependent antibiotic (CDA). The absA genes themselves are growth phase regulated, with phospho-AbsA2 responsible for growth phase-related positive autoregulation.

These advancements have enabled humans to leverage the capabilities of such systems to enhance quality and efficiency in numerous fields. Artificial intelligence (AI), recognized as a dynamic and integrated system, has expanded its influence across diverse scientific disciplines. This widespread adoption has led to a significant increase in demand from both users and organizations. Among the many branches of AI, natural language processing (NLP)-which focuses on the analysis of textual and auditory data-has seen remarkable growth over the past two decades. This growth is driven by the explosive generation of text data, coupled with advancements in processing power, memory resources, and the development of novel concepts and architectures such as transformers, attention mechanisms, and large linguistic models. Consequently, NLP has garnered significant attention within the research and development communities. At the intersection of AI & law, this study introduces a novel framework for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in legal contexts. Specifically, we propose a framework based on the T5 language model, trained to analyze the sentiments of parties involved in legal cases using the SigmaLaw-ABSA dataset. Our framework classifies the sentiments of the parties into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative. This enables the distinction between constructive and inefficient sentiments within legal texts, which can facilitate a more effective and efficient legal hearing process. To assess the performance of our proposed model, we evaluate it using accuracy and F1-Score metrics after fine-tuning it on a processed training dataset. The results demonstrate promising performance, with an accuracy of 82.83% and an F1-Score of 81.45%. These outcomes suggest that our model achieves a high level of accuracy, positioning it as a leading approach in this area of research.","[Melal, Sevda Rezaei] Univ Guilan, Sch Humanities, Dept Law, Rasht, Iran; [Melal, Sepehr Rezaei] Univ Guilan, Sch Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Rasht, Iran; [Khanjani-Shiraz, Rashed] Univ Osnabruck, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Osnabruck, Germany; [Khanjani-Shiraz, Rashed] Univ Appl Sci Sudwestfalen, Dept Engn & Econ, Iserlohn, Germany",University of Guilan; University of Guilan; University Osnabruck,"Khanjani-Shiraz, R (corresponding author), Univ Osnabruck, Sch Business Adm & Econ, Osnabruck, Germany.;Khanjani-Shiraz, R (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci Sudwestfalen, Dept Engn & Econ, Iserlohn, Germany.",sevdarezaeimelal@gmail.com; sepehrrezaeimelal@gmail.com; rashed.khanjani.shiraz@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,42,0,0,1,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2364-415X,2364-4168,,INT J DATA SCI ANAL,"Int.

Many review papers on ABSA subtasks and solution methodologies exist, however, few focus on trends over time or systemic issues relating to research application domains, datasets, and solution approaches. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of ABSA studies with a focus on trends and high-level relationships among these fundamental components. This review is one of the largest SLRs on ABSA. To our knowledge, it is also the first to systematically examine the interrelations among ABSA research and data distribution across domains, as well as trends in solution paradigms and approaches. Our sample includes 727 primary studies screened from 8550 search results without time constraints via an innovative automatic filtering process. Our quantitative analysis not only identifies trends in nearly two decades of ABSA research development but also unveils a systemic lack of dataset and domain diversity as well as domain mismatch that may hinder the development of future ABSA research.

Q-MWNTs provide a conductive and stable network for the poly-ABSA (PABSA) immobilization. The voltammetric behaviors of methotrexate (MTX) and calcium folinate (CF) at the PABSA/Q-MWNTs/GCE were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compared with bare GCE, Q-MWNTs/GCE and PABSA/GCE, the PABSA/Q-MWNTs/GCE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic oxidation toward MTX and CF. Separation of the oxidation peak potentials for MTX and CF was 0.26 V in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0), which made it suitable for simultaneous determination of these two compounds by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under the optimized conditions, the anodic peak current of MTX was linear with the concentration from 0.1 to 8.0 mu M in the presence of 8.0 mu M CF, with a detection limit of 0.015 mu M (S/N = 3). At the same time, the anodic current of CF was linear with the concentration from 0.1 to 6.5 mu M with a detection limit of 0.020 mu M in the presence of 8.0 mu M MTX.

Ag nanoparticles can act as tiny conduction centers on electrodes that adsorb redox enzymes, facilitating the transfer of electrons with no requiring any loss of biological activity. The forerunner film was first electropolymerized on the glassy carbon electrode with p-aminobenzene sulfonic acid (p-ABSA) by cyclic voltammetry. The cysteamine (CA) was bound on the surface of the film by electrostatic force, then Ag nanoparticles were immobilized on the cysteamine monolayer, and lastly HRP was adsorbed onto the surfaces of the Ag nanoparticles.

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the polarity of opinions expressed in a text. The more complex stage of sentiment analysis is known as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), where it is possible to ascertain both the actual topics being discussed by the speakers as well as the polarity of each opinion. Nowadays, people leave comments on a variety of websites, including social networking sites, online news sources, and even YouTube video comment sections, on a wide range of topics. ABSA can play a significant role in utilizing these comments for a variety of objectives, including academic, commercial, and socioeconomic development. In English and many other popular European languages, there are many datasets for ABSA, but the Bengali language has very few of them. As a result, ABSA research on Bengali is relatively rare. In this paper, we present a Bengali dataset that has been manually annotated with five aspects and their corresponding sentiment. A baseline evaluation was also carried out using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, with 97% aspect detection accuracy and 77% sentiment classification accuracy. For aspect detection, the F1-score was 0.97 and for sentiment classification, it was 0.77.","[Samia, Moythry Manir; Rajee, Alimul; Hasan, Md Rakib; Paul, Pintu Chandra] Comilla Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Cumilla, Bangladesh; [Faruq, Mohammad Omar] Comilla Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Cumilla, Bangladesh",Comilla University; Comilla University,"Samia, MM; Rajee, A (corresponding author), Comilla Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Cumilla, Bangladesh.",,"Hasan, Rakib/ABG-1014-2022; Rajee, Alimul/HLQ-5163-2023; FARUQ, Dr. Engr.

First, a novel sub-network is introduced to represent a target in a sentence in ABSA by considering the whole context. Second, lexicon embedding is applied to incorporate additional lexical cues.

Most recent studies adopted attention-based neural network models to implicitly connect aspect terms with context words. However, these studies were limited by insufficient interaction between aspect terms and opinion words, leading to poor performance on robustness test sets. In addition, we have found that robustness test sets create new sentences that interfere with the original information of a sentence, which often makes the text too long and leads to the problem of long-distance dependence. Simultaneously, these new sentences produce more non-target aspect terms, misleading the model because of the lack of relevant knowledge guidance. This study proposes a knowledge guided multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (KMGCN) to solve these problems. The multi-granularity attention mechanism is designed to enhance the interaction between aspect terms and opinion words. To address the long-distance dependence, KMGCN uses a graph convolutional network that relies on a semantic map based on fine-tuning pre-trained models. In particular, KMGCN uses a mask mechanism guided by conceptual knowledge to encounter more aspect terms (including target and non-target aspect terms). Experiments are conducted on 12 SemEval-2014 variant benchmarking datasets, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","[Zhu, Zhenfang; Zhang, Dianyuan; Li, Kefeng; Qi, Jiangtao; Zhang, Guangyuan] Shandong Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Elect Engn, Jinan 250357, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenling] Lu Dong Univ, Chinese Lexicog Res Ctr, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China; [Liu, Peiyu] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250358, Peoples R China",Shandong Jiaotong University; Wuhan University of Technology; Ludong University; Shandong Normal University,"Zhang, DY (corresponding author), Shandong Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Elect Engn, Jinan 250357, Peoples R China.",zhuzf@sdjtu.edu.cn; csdzdy@163.com; cathylilin@whut.edu.cn; 205073@sdjtu.edu.cn; qijiangtaohappy@hotmail.com; 362607793@qq.com; xdzhanggy@163.com; liupy@sdnu.edu.cn,"?, ??/JXM-0584-2024; Zhang, Guangyuan/HKE-9192-2023; Liu, peiyu/AAE-3641-2021; Li, Li/AEM-3636-2022; Qi, Jiangtao/AAL-6502-2020; ZHU, ZHENFANG/LDE-9077-2024",,"National Social Science Foundation of China [19BYY076, ZR2021MF064, ZR2021QG041]; Key R & D project of Shandong Province [2019JZZY010129]; Shandong Natural Science Foundation; Shandong Social Science Planning Foundation [19BJCJ51]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key R & D project of Shandong Province; Shandong Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Shandong Social Science Planning Foundation,"This work was supported in part by National Social Science Foundation (19BYY076); of China (ZR2021MF064, ZR2021QG041); Key R & D project of Shandong Province 2019JZZY010129, Shandong Natural Science Foundation, Shandong Social Science Planning Foundation (19BJCJ51).",,48,53,56,4,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0306-4573,1873-5371,,INFORM PROCESS MANAG,Inf.

To cope with these limitations, we propose a new method based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the multi-head attention mechanism, called the attention interactive encoder network (AIEN). The GCN was used to obtain the syntactic information that has the greatest syntactic impact on the aspect based on the syntax dependency tree. The multi-head attention mechanism can not only obtain the context-aware information of the given aspects, but also the interaction information between multiple representations of the aspect itself. The high-level information generated by the interaction of multi-dimensional features can produce a stronger representation ability for the aspect.

This research work is interested in both aspect and sentence levels. It starts with the ABSA which is in turn divided into two strongly coupled tasks, namely the aspect extraction and the aspect sentiment classification. Indeed, integrating highly coupled tasks into an integrated model can lead to more significant performance improvement rather than in the case of separate models, which is also confirmed through the proposed ABSA model. The latter represents a unified-trained model based on deep learning techniques for extracting the aspects along with their sentiment polarities. Later on, the emphasis would be put on SBSA, which is a complex study, especially with the existence of opinions that include several aspects with opposing polarities. From this perspective, a combination of deep learning and fuzzy logic techniques was elaborated to address this issue.

Leveraging a diverse set of datasets, including DOTSA, MAMS, and SemEval16, we evaluate the performance of prominent models such as ATAE-LSTM, flan-t5-large-absa, DeBERTa, PaLM, and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our findings reveal nuanced strengths and weaknesses of these models across different domains, with DeBERTa emerging as consistently high-performing and PaLM demonstrating remarkable competitiveness for aspect term sentiment analysis (ATSA) tasks. In addition, the PaLM demonstrates competitive performance for all the domains that were used in the experiments including the restaurant, hotel, books, clothing, and laptop reviews. Notably, the analysis underscores the models' domain sensitivity, shedding light on their varying efficacy for both ATSA and ACSA tasks. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of model applicability and highlight potential areas for improvement in ABSA research and development.","[Mughal, Nimra; Mujtaba, Ghulam] Sukkur IBA Univ, Ctr Excellence Robot Artificial Intelligence & Blo, Dept Comp Sci, Sukkur 65200, Sindh, Pakistan; [Shaikh, Sarang] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Informat Secur & Commun Technol IIK, N-7034 Gjovik, Trondheim, Norway; [Kumar, Aveenash] Learners Ai, Toronto, ON M5C 2B5, Canada; [Daudpota, Sher Muhammad] Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Sukkur 65200, Sindh, Pakistan",Sukkur IBA University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Sukkur IBA University,"Mughal, N (corresponding author), Sukkur IBA Univ, Ctr Excellence Robot Artificial Intelligence & Blo, Dept Comp Sci, Sukkur 65200, Sindh, Pakistan.;Shaikh, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Informat Secur & Commun Technol IIK, N-7034 Gjovik, Trondheim, Norway.",nimra.cs16@gmail.com; sarang.shaikh@ntnu.no,"Daudpota, Sher/AAN-2438-2020; Mujtaba, Ghulam/AAJ-9326-2020","Daudpota, Sher Muhammad/0000-0001-6684-751X; Mughal, Nimra/0000-0002-3981-8382; Shaikh, Sarang/0000-0003-2099-4797","National Research Program for Universities (NRPU), Higher Education Commission, Pakistan","National Research Program for Universities (NRPU), Higher Education Commission, Pakistan",No Statement Available,,79,11,11,25,82,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12.0,,,,,,60943.0,60959.0,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3386969,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3386969,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,PL7L1,,gold,,,2025-06-08,WOS:001214298100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One way to efficiently extract this information is by using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). The role of ABSA of apps reviews is to identify all app's aspects being reviewed and assign a sentiment polarity towards each aspect. This paper aims to build ABSA models using supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches. Our automated technique is intended to (1) identify the most useful and effective text-representation and task-specific features in both Aspect Category Detection (ACD) and Aspect Category Polarity, (2) empirically investigate the performance of conventional ML models when utilized for ABSA task of apps reviews, and (3) empirically compare the performance of ML models and DL models in the context of ABSA task. We built the models using different algorithms/architectures and performed hyper-parameters tuning. In addition, we extracted a set of relevant features for the ML models and performed an ablation study to analyze their contribution to the performance. Our empirical study showed that the ML model trained using Logistic Regression algorithm and BERT embeddings outperformed the other models. Although ML outperformed DL, DL models do not require hand-crafted features and they allow for a better learning of features when trained with more data.","[Alturayeif, Nouf; Aljamaan, Hamoud; Hassine, Jameleddine] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Informat & Comp Sci Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Alturayeif, Nouf] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Comp Dept, Dammam, Saudi Arabia; [Hassine, Jameleddine] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Intelligent Secure Syst, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Aljamaan, Hamoud] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Finance & Digital Econ, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,"Alturayeif, N (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Informat & Comp Sci Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.;Alturayeif, N (corresponding author), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Comp Dept, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.",g201901790@kfupm.edu.sa; hjamaan@kfupm.edu.sa; jhassine@kfupm.edu.sa,"Alturayeif, Nora/E-7679-2017; Aljamaan, Hamoud/N-9756-2019; Hassine, Jameleddine/E-5940-2015","Alturayeif, Nouf/0000-0002-2761-8420; Aljamaan, Hamoud/0000-0002-2146-9348",The authors would like to acknowledge the support of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in the development of this work.; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM),The authors would like to acknowledge the support of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in the development of this work.; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM)(King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals),The authors would like to acknowledge the support of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in the development of this work.,,61,10,10,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0928-8910,1573-7535,,AUTOMAT SOFTW ENG,Automat.

Most existing works address these sub-tasks independently by applying a supervised learning approach using labeled data. However, obtaining such labeled sentences is difficult and extremely expensive. Hence, it is important to solve ABSA without taking a dependency on labeled sentences. In this work, we propose a three-step semi-supervised hybrid approach that jointly detects an aspect and its associated sentiment in a given review sentence. The first step of our approach takes a small set of seed words for each aspect and sentiment class to construct respective semantically coherent class vocabularies. The second step makes use of these constructed vocabularies along with POS tags to label a subset of sentences from the training corpus. As we adopt a semi-automated approach to label the data, this process may induce noise in the labels during the annotation. In the last step, we use such labeled sentences to build a noise-robust deep neural network for aspect and sentiment classification.

We have developed an aptamer-based sandwich assay (ABSA) platform that demonstrates a promising potential for use in pathogen detection using aptamers as analytical bioconjugates. The whole-bacteria SELEX (WB-SELEX) strategy was adopted to generate aptamers with high affinity and specificity against live Listeria monocytogenes. Of the 35 aptamer candidates tested, LMCA2 and LMCA26 reacted to Listeria monocytogenes with high binding, and were consequently chosen as sensing probes. The ABSA platform can significantly enhance the sensitivity by employing a very specific aptamer pair for the sandwich complex. The ABSA platform exhibited a linear response over a wide concentration range of Listeria monocytogenes from 20 to 2 x 10(6) CFU per mL and was closely correlated with the following relationship: y=9533.3x + 1542.3 (R-2=0.99). Our proposed ABSA platform also provided excellent specificity for the tests to distinguish Listeria monocytogenes from other Listeria species and other bacterial genera (3 Listeria spp., 4 Salmonella spp., 2 Vibrio spp., 3 Escherichia coli and 3 Shigella spp.). Improvements in the sensitivity and specificity have not only facilitated the reliable detection of Listeria monocytogenes at extremely low concentrations, but also allowed for the development of a 96-well plate-based routine assay platform for multivalent diagnostics.

This work examines the performance of ABSA in the cross-domain scenario where models trained on the review data of one domain for example electronics domain are applied to another domain such as fashion domain. Here, we put forward a risk mitigation strategy that builds upon transfer learning and domain adversarial training methodologies to enhance the overall resilience and reliability of sentiment estimations across multiple product domains. The proposed model was tested using data obtained from different e-commerce retailers, such as Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba concerning various categories of products including electronics, fashion, and home appliances. The outcome of experiments show better performance over most of the compared methods of single-domain ABSA and cross-domain approaches. The model offered greater accuracy, recall rate, F1- score, and cross-domain efficiency, which demonstrated the model's effectiveness and versatility. The consequences for e-business companies are significant. Improved sentiment analysis allows businesses to obtain more specific data about customers' opinions, correct mistakes when developing products, and adjust their advertising approaches. Also, the use of advanced text analytics to measure and monitor such aspects in different product areas offers a competitive edge and improves product innovation decisions. However, there are several limitations to the study itself, such as the variations that may arise among the domain, and the limited availability of the data. Further work is to be done on more complex and sophisticated methods of domain adaptation, using external resources; the main model itself should also be much faster and more efficient in scalability. This work thus indicates an opportunity for cross-domain ABSA to generate practical insights for enhancing customers' experience within e-commerce.","[Xu, Yadi; Ibrahim, Noor Farizah] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Xu, YD (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town, Malaysia.",yadixu@student.usm.my; nfarizah@usm.my,"Ibrahim, Noor/AAF-1000-2020; Xu, Yadi/GZL-4346-2022",,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,Shimur Publications,New Moti Nagar,"Tc-1/7, TC-1, New Moti Nagar, Delhi, INDIA",,2582-9793,,ADV ARTIF INTELL MAC,Adv.

Most existing works address these subtasks independently. Recently, many researchers have attempted to solve both the subtasks of ABSA with a unified framework. However, previous works have not focused on the generalization and robustness of such unified frameworks. This paper proposes a novel BERT-Based Interactive Learning with Ensemble Adversarial Training (BILEAT) to solve complete ABSA by using a unified tagging scheme. We build white-box adversarially post-trained domain knowledge BERT (WBDK-BERT) using a domain-specific dataset. During post-training, we regularize the training objective by adding perturbations in the embedding space to maximize the adversarial loss, enhancing the generalization and robustness of WBDK-BERT. BILEAT uses WBDK-BERT to generate contextualized embeddings and produce collaborative signals through interactive learning. Further, to build a highly reliable model, we generate adversarial examples using a black-box technique. These adversarial examples are grammatically fluent, semantically coherent with original input, and can mislead the neural network. Our proposed model is trained using original inputs and such adversarial examples in a combined way. Experimental results demonstrate that WBDK-BERT and black-box adversarial examples complement each other, and combining these two helps BILEAT become highly generalized and robust compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that generates quality adversarial examples and evaluates the robustness of models for unified ABSA(1).","[Kumar, Avinash; Balan, Raghunathan; Gupta, Pranjal; Neti, Lalita Bhanu Murthy; Malapati, Aruna] Birla Inst Technol Sci Pilani Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500078, India",Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani),"Kumar, A (corresponding author), Birla Inst Technol Sci Pilani Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500078, India.",p20150507@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in,"Malapati, Aruna/AAE-9343-2019","Kumar, Avinash/0000-0001-7953-0247; Gupta, Pranjal/0000-0002-0344-0859",,,,,47,2,3,2,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-669X,1573-7497,,APPL INTELL,Appl.

To address this challenge, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework called Cross-Domain Data Augmentation (CDDA) has been proposed. The main idea is to use labeled source domain data to generate a large amount of labeled target domain data, thereby bridging the gap between domains. However, previous methods that applied CDDA often did not fully utilize the general knowledge such as linguistic features in the source domain, and the quality of the pseudo-labels annotated by the base model led to low quality of the subsequent generated data. In this paper, we propose a Data Augmentation Framework with Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DAEGCN) for cross-domain ABSA. This model can effectively obtain domain-specific segments information and linguistic feature knowledge, and uses a domain adversarial neural network to reduce the differences between the two domains, and then uses a graph convolutional network to learn and annotate pseudo-labels for the target domain. Then, the model removes fragments of nouns and adjectives in the text of the two domains and uses them as inputs to the BART model for training, generating labeled data in the target domain as the final augmented data. Experimental results on four different domain datasets show that DAEGCN achieves better results than other domain adaptation methods.","[Yu, Rui; Xia, Hongbin; Liu, Yuan] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Comp Sci, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Hongbin; Liu, Yuan] Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Key Univ Lab Software & Media Technol Huma, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University,"Xia, HB (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Comp Sci, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Xia, HB (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Jiangsu Key Univ Lab Software & Media Technol Huma, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hbxia@jiangnan.edu.cn,"Liu, Yuan/LRU-9944-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972182],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61972182).,,45,0,0,9,11,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1863-2386,1863-2394,,SERV ORIENTED COMPUT,Serv.

Most historical works on sentiment analysis used complex and inefficient methods to integrate external knowledge. Furthermore, they fell short of completely utilizing BERT's potential because when trying to generate word embeddings, they merely averaged the BERT subword vectors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a knowledge-guided heterogeneous graph convolutional network for aspect-based sentiment analysis (KHGCN). Specifically, we consider merging subword vectors utilizing a dynamic weight mechanism in the BERT embedding layer. Additionally, heterogeneous graphs are constructed to fuse different feature associations between words, and graph convolutional networks are utilized to identify context-specific syntactic features. Furthermore, by embedding a knowledge graph, the model can learn additional features from sources other than the corpus. Based on this knowledge, it is consequently possible to obtain more knowledge representation for a particular aspect by utilizing the attention mechanism. Last but not least, semantic features, syntactic features, and knowledge are dynamically combined using feature fusion. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracy rates of 80.87%, 85.42%, and 91.07%, which is an improvement of more than 2% compared to other benchmark models based on HGCNs and BERT.","[Song, Xiangxiang; Ling, Guang; Tu, Wenhui; Chen, Yu] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Ling, G (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",songxiang@whut.edu.cn; guangling@whut.edu.cn; tuwenhui@whut.edu.cn; 261376@whut.edu.cn,,,,,,,57,0,0,8,33,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,FEB,2024,13.0,3,,,,,,,517,10.3390/electronics13030517,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics13030517,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,HN2J7,,gold,,,2025-06-08,WOS:001160115100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In spite of the exceptional progress, the ASC experiences certain pitfalls as (1) The current attention based methods makes the given aspect to falsely relate syntactically unrelated words as related ones. (2) Single context-independent representation is only achieved by traditional Word2Vec or GloVe based embedding vectors. (3) Sentiments for multiple words that are inconsecutive remain insufficient for CNN based models. A Sparse-Self-Attention-based Gated Recurrent Unit with Aspect Embedding (SSA-GRU-AE) implementing BERT for ASC is proposed to solve these issues. The proposed SSA-GRU-AE mechanism is centralized on various portions of sentence as multiple aspects are taken as input. The experimental analysis on ASC datasets has proved that proposed model enhanced performance on ASC.","[Dhanith, P. R. Joe; Kanmani, Sujithra R.; Devi, K.
